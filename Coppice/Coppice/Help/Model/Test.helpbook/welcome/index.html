<p>Welcome to the Coppice Blog, the best place to get all the latest news on Coppice, as well as tips on how to get the most out of Coppice and sneak peeks into future versions. Coppice is a great new app for the Mac that allows you to organise and make sense of your thoughts. You can find out more about Coppice from the <a href="features" data-help-id="exploring_coppice">Features</a> and <a href="faq" data-help-id="privacy">FAQ</a> pages of this site.</p>

<p>We're still putting the final touches to Coppice, but we're hoping to share a lot about it over the coming weeks and months before release, including an in-depth look at how Coppice works, what prompted us to create Coppice, and even a look at our plans beyond the initial release.</p>
