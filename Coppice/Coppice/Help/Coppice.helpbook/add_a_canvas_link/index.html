<h1>Adding a Canvas Link</h1>
<p>Canvas Links show a link between two pages on a canvas. These are created for you if you click on a page link on a canvas to add a page. However, there are also ways to add canvas links between pages that are already on a canvas</p>

<details>
<summary>Add Link to Existing Page</summary>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Canvas you wish to add the link to</li>
  <li>Command-click on a Page Link</li>
</ol>

<p>If the linked page already exists, a Canvas Link will be created between the two pages. If the page does not exist it will be added to the canvas</p>

<summary>Add Link to Existing Pages by Default (Pro only)</summary>
<p>By default Coppice will open a new copy of a page on a canvas when you click on a page link, and link to an existing page when command-clicking. With a Coppice Pro subscription you swap that behaviour</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Coppice > Settings…</strong> (<abbr title="command-comma">⌘,</abbr>) from the menu bar</li>
  <li>Click on the General tab</li>
  <li>Check Link to existing pages by default</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Create New Link Between Existing Pages (Pro only)</summary>
<ol>
<li>Start editing the Page you wish to create a link between</li>
<li>Select the text or image hotspot you wish to create a link on
    <aside class="tip">Tip: If you select an existing page link this process will update that link rather than creating a new link</aside></li>
<li>Select <strong>Canvas > Link to Page</strong> (<abbr title="command-option-L">⌥⌘L</abbr>) from the menu bar</li>
<li>Move the mouse cursor over the page you wish to select, it will highlight</li>
<li>Click on the highlighted page</li>
