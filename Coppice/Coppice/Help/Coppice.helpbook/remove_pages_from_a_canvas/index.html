<h1>Remove Pages From a Canvas</h1>
<p>Pages can be removed from a Canvas by closing them. Closing a Page will close it and any linked child branches spanning from that Page.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>{[link|select_pages|Select the Page(s)]} you wish to close</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Canvas > Close Selected Pages</strong> from the menu bar<br>
    <span class="alternate">Alternatively, click the close button in the titlebar of a page</span></li>
  </ol>

<p>You should never be afraid to close child Pages and branches on a Canvas. As long as the root Page stays on the Canvas, Coppice will remember the size and position of every child branch, so the next time you click a link to open a page, all the pages will be restored.</p>
